# Class 3: HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model

**Learning Objectives**

As a result of completing Day 3 of Code 201, students will:

- Demonstrate understanding of and classify assorted control flow techniques in JavaScript including ‘for’ loops, ‘if’ and if/else’, as well as  ‘while’ and ‘do/while’ structures, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas
- Demonstrate understanding of and explain what HTML element attributes are and how to use them, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas
- Demonstrate understanding of and illustrate the CSS box model, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas
- Demonstrate an understanding of JavaScript Arrays, how to use them, and a basic familiarity with the most common Array methods.

## Understanding Strict Mode

Strict mode in JavaScript helps catch common errors and make the JS engine more efficient. To enable it, put the line

```javascript
'use strict';
```

at the top of all your JS files. To learn more about how it works, [read the docs!](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode)
