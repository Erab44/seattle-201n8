# Class 1: Introduction to the Tools and Fundamentals of Development

<a id="top"></a>
# Class 1 Plan:Lecture  

- [Kickoff! (with slides)](#kickoff) *[60 minutes]*
- [Academic Overview (with slides)](#academic) *[45 minutes]*
- [Set up a JavaScript linter](#linter) *[30 minutes]*
- [Verify Student Toolbelts](#toolbelt) *[30-45 minutes]*

> The above will take the entire duration of night 1. This means that students should expect to have lecture continue on night 2 leading into their first lab assignment.  

# Class 1(pt.2): Lecture  

- [Unix & Git (with slides)](#ug) *[60 minutes]*
- [Go over the assigned readings](#readings) *[30 minutes]*
- [Code demo to prep for lab](#code) *[60 minutes]*
- [LAB](#lab) *[until 9:30]*
  - Write code as outlined in the lab assignment

**Learning Objectives**

As a result of completing Class 1 of Code 201, students will be able to:
- create a HTML page from scratch, with proper HTML5 hierarchical structure conventions, as demonstrated by successful completion of the daily code assignment
- properly include a \<script> tag in an HTML document that will interact with the user via prompt/alert, as demonstrated by successful completion of the daily code assignment
- write JavaScript that will interact with the user via prompt/alert, as demonstrated by successful completion of the daily code assignment
- use the command line to create and change directories, create and list files, and open files in a text editor and in a web browser, as demonstrated by successful completion of the daily code assignment
- install & use plugins for their text editor, including a minimap and a JavaScript linter, as measured by observations of the instructional staff

## Kickoff!  

This is the welcome and introduction to Code Fellows. Students will meet the campus manager and learn about campus operations and policies.

## Academic Overview  

[Slides: 2-academic-overview.pdf](slides/2-academic-overview.pdf)

The instructor will give an overview of the topics to be covered in this course and how those topics fit into the overall academic program at Code Fellows.

## Verify Student Toolbelts

By doing a few quick tests and exercises, as detailed below, ensure that students have functionality of all of the core pieces of their development environment:
- Atom: type `atom` in the command line to verify that it opens properly. Command line tools may need to be installed.
- Atom packages: Be sure that they have linter, minimap,and  open-in-browser installed.
- Chrome: how to open the console
- Git: enter `which git` in the command line to verify installation
- Directory structure: Have students set up a directory at ~/codefellows/201/ in which they will store their classwork. Go over directory structure in general; compare to GUI.

## Live code

This code demo is to help students be ready to complete the first assignment and also to show off some functionality of the REPL and Chrome Developer Tools. This demo should also reveal any lingering issues with student computer setups.
